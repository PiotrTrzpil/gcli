# gcli

CLI to any GraphQL server

## Setup

1. Install https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli

2. In a directory of your choice, run `graphql init` and setup a project with a default endpoint.

This will create .graphqlconfig.yaml file that then will be used by gcli. The project name will be used in commands, e.g.:

```
gcli github viewer url
```
